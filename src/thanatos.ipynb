      "The TITLE of this research paper is: MFCC-Chroma Fusion using a Dual-Channel CNN-LSTM and Demographic-Aware Random Forest for Lung Sound Disease Classification\n",
      "The ABSTRACT of this research paper is: Pulmonary diseases continue to pose significant diagnostic challenges. Auscultation, a common method for lung sound analysis, remains subjective and prone to inconsistency. This study proposes two complementary approaches for improving lung disease detection: (1) a dual-channel CNN-LSTM model using MFCC-Chroma fusion for automated lung sound classification, and (2) a Random Forest model to assess the viability of incorporating patient demographic data. Both models were trained and evaluated using the ICBHI 2017 dataset. Experimental results show that Models 4A and 4B from the dual-channel CNN-LSTM architecture achieved up to 80% accuracy, while demographic features also proved valuable for classification. Compared to prior works in the CLSA domain, the proposed models offer competitive performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and class-wise fairness. These findings highlight the potential of both advanced audio feature fusion and demographic-aware learning in enhanci\n",

      "The ABSTRACT of this research paper is: The study investigates the usability of the Facial Recognition Biometrics in iOS and Android operating systems among Computer Science students of Saint Louis University. The study was conducted by administering IBM’s Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) to assess the respondents’ perceived usability satisfaction towards the facial recognition biometrics of their smartphones. Open-ended questions were also administered, asking about the improvements and enhancements the current facial recognition biometrics should have. The results reveal that the respondents have a high perceived usability satisfaction in the Facial Recognition Biometrics of their mobile phones on iOS and Android. It is also revealed that there is a significant difference in the overall PSSUQ score, System Usefulness score, and Interface Quality score towards the facial recognition biometrics between iOS and Android users.\n",

      "The ABSTRACT of this research paper is: The study aims to develop a Finite State Accepter that validates plate numbers in the Philippines for motor vehicles and motorcycles pursuant to the latest valid plate number formats released by the Land Transportation Office (LTO): LLL DDDD, L DDD LL, and DDD LLL. A consolidated Finite State Accepter was developed that identifies and validates plate numbers that follow the specified formats. The automaton was then implemented through a computer program to test its accuracy and precision by subjecting it to 100 valid plate numbers and 50 invalid plate numbers. The results show that all of the valid test plate numbers were accepted while all of the invalid plate numbers were rejected by the program. The results demonstrate the reliability and efficacy of the developed Finite State Accepter in accurately accepting valid plate numbers and rejecting invalid ones.\n",
